# 3D_dominoes
Simulation of the toppling of series of evenly spaced dominoes. 
The folders correspond to three different spacings between the blocks. 
These simulations were run using the simulation platform LMGC90, developed at the University of Montpellier in France. 
Each simulation has two steps.
1. The construction of the mechanical system (scripts ge_sample.py)
2. The simulation under the loads or motions that are preset in step 1 (scripts command.py). 

The geometry of the systems, the friction coefficients, the gravity, and contact behavior between bodies are also set in step 1. 
Once the software LMGC90 is correctly installed, the construction and simulations scripts are simply run using a python interpreter.
